# SadPencil.Ra2CsfFile

v1.2.2

## Converters
This is a tool that converts CSF file from/to INI file. The INI file is much more friendly to editing, cooperating with others, and to be stored in Git. It is recommended that only saves the INI file. The CSF file should be derived from the INI file, just like compiling a program file into an executable.

Usage: place a file named `input.csf` and run the program `SadPencil.CsfToIni.exe`, an `output.csf.ini` file will be created. Similarly, place a file named `input.csf.ini` and run the program `SadPencil.IniToCsf.exe`,  an `output.csf` file will be created. 

## .NET Library
For developers, you may make use of the SadPencil.Ra2CsfFile library.
